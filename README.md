This is rather delicate, and I haven't spent too much time yet making it portable. So if you are someone that wants the code to work on your computer, feel free to try it out!
Just know that you might need to have some patience with me :)
I run scopetest.py from the command line and used ffmpeg to just overlay a royalty free mp3 file on top of the generated mp4 file.

```sh
docker compose run yt-animations
```
